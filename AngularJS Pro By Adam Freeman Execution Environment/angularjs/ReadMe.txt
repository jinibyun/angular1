All examples is in "angularjs" folder.

note: nodejs and deployd folder is same level as angularjs folder, therefore they are not showing in vs.project

1. go to "nodejs" folder in command console and type (web server running via node.js)
node server.js   (Internally it is running 5000)

2. go to "deployd\sportsstore" folder and click app.dpd file to run deployd application (api service)
To confirm this, type http://localhost:XXXX/products

(XXXX seems to be dynamical port number assigned)

3. To run app.html, type http://localhost:5000/app.html

(NOTE)folder "chapter 01...chapter 25" is just copy and paste from source folder

4. chapter 1 - 21 까지 모두 진행했음

5. chapter 22 부터 25는 진행하지 않았고, 이에 대해서는 추후 참고 형식으로 공부 할 것
